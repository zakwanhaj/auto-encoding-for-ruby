# Auto Encoding for Ruby

It's an Atom package for automatically adding `# encoding: utf-8` at beginning on every Ruby file with non-ASCII characters. It saves the time from doing a boring task for adding the encoding declaration manually. There are many options to implement this tool either on current opened editor (right click on wherever in the code then `Add #encoding utf-8` or go to packages then Auto Encoding for Ruby), on selected file (inside tree view, right click on the file then `Add #encoding utf-8` ) or on selected directory (in tree view and right click too). When choosing a selected directory, the package adds the encoding declaration in all Ruby files inside the selected directory.
